# Emissions-MIP_Data
Emissions Model Intercomparison Project

# Description
This repository contains the timeseries data generated by ESMValTool for each climate model as well as the scripts used to create the timeseries and summary plots. A current copy of the plots is stored here as well.

The climate models currently included are CESM1, CESM2-WACCM, E3SMv1, GEOS-i33p2, GFDL-AM4.1, GISS ModelE2.1, HadGEM-UKCA, MIROC-SPRINTARS, NorESM, OsloCTM3. This repository will be updated in the future as more models are made available.

## Directories
### code
This directory contains the R scripts used to generate the plots. Before running these scripts, remember to specify the location of the "Emissions-MIP" directory to its location on your computer (*i.e.*, variable `emi_dir`). Also, specify the region to generate plots for.

### input
The perturbation and reference data are included for each region (*e.g.*, global, land, sea, etc.). These are csv files of annual, averaged (over respective region) data generated by ESMValTool.

### output
Two types of plots are generated - timeseries and summary plots. The timeseries plots include the reference (base) case, the absolute difference between the perturbations and the reference case, and the percent difference between the perturbations and the reference case. The summary plots exhibit the absolute and percent differences averaged over all years for each perturbation.
